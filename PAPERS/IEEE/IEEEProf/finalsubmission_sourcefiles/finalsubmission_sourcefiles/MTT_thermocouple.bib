The temperature is probed using four thermocouples located at different distances from the heater. A good quantitative agreement, within 30\%, between the experimental data and the modeling is obtained. Since we observe a strong thickness dependence of the electrical conductivity of our metals, we find that the Joule heating in nanoscale devices is often incorrectly calculated if bulk conductivities are used. Furthermore, Peltier heating/cooling is investigated and the combination with Seebeck temperature measurements provides us with a method to determine the Seebeck coefficient of a material.},

The latter is negative and its magnitude is found to increase initially with increasing temperature, reach a maximum, and then decrease with a further rise in temperature. The temperature at which the Seebeck coefficient is maximum is found to be thickness dependent, decreasing with increasing thickness. The observed dependence is explained by considering that the Fermi energy is temperature dependent. Bismuth films show a negative temperature coefficient of resistivity. The thickness dependence of the electrical resistivity and the Seebeck coefficient of simultaneously prepared films are analyzed using the newer effective mean-free-path model. From the analysis, important material constants like the mean free path, the electron concentration, and the effective mass of electrons have been evaluated.},

  Abstract                 = {The role of dimensionality on the electronic performance of thermoelectric devices is clarified using the Landauer formalism, which shows that the thermoelectric coefficients are related to the transmission, T ( E ) , and how the conducting channels, M ( E ) , are distributed in energy. The Landauer formalism applies from the ballistic to diffusive limits and provides a clear way to compare performance in different dimensions. It also provides a physical interpretation of the ``transport distribution,'' a quantity that arises in the Boltzmann transport equation approach. Quantitative comparison of thermoelectric coefficients in one, two, and three dimensions shows that the channels are utilized more effectively in lower dimensions. To realize the advantage of lower dimensionality, however, the packing density must be very high, so the thicknesses of the quantum wells or wires must be small. The potential benefits of engineering M ( E ) into a delta function are also investigated. When compared with a bulk semiconductor, we find the potential for ∼ 50 \% improvement in performance. The shape of M ( E ) improves as dimensionality decreases, but lower dimensionality itself does not guarantee better performance because it is controlled by both the shape and the magnitude of M ( E ) . The benefits of engineering the shape of M ( E ) appear to be modest, but approaches to increase the magnitude of M ( E ) could pay large dividends.},

  Abstract                 = {Hyperbolic heat conduction problems in cylindrical and spherical coordinate systems are investigated numerically. Unlike the classical Fourier heat flux model, the thermal wave of such problems propagates with a finite speed. The major difficulty in dealing with such problems is the suppression of numerical oscillations in the vicinity of a jump discontinuity. The proposed numerical method combines the Laplace transform technique for the time domain and the control volume formulation for the space domain. The transformed nodal temperatures are inverted to the physical quantities by using numerical inversion of the Laplace transform. Due to the application of a hyperbolic shape function, it can be seen from the illustrated examples that the present numerical solutions are stable and accurate. The application of the hyperbolic shape function can successfully suppress the numerical oscillations in the vicinity of jump discontinuities. Comparisons with the results obtained from the Fourier law are also presented for some basic problems.},

  Abstract                 = {A new method has been developed in order to identify the thermal environment of a semiconductor device chip. The identification algorithm operates on the thermal transient response of the device recorded during a one-shot pulse measurement. A deconvolution operation performed in the logarithmic time domain gives the ``time-constant spectrum'' of the chip-case-ambient thermal structure. A further transformation leads to the ``structure-function'' that is the cross-sectional area of the heat conducting materials vs thermal resistance (related to the heat source). The structure function has a good and quantitatively evaluable correspondence to the physical chip environment and heat conducting structure. Separating the different regions of the heat-flow path (corresponding to the chip, bond, header, case) as well as the detection of eventual heat-transport irregularities (mounting errors) is possible.},

We have developed a characterization platform, with which the Seebeck coefficient of nanowires can be measured as required for the calibration of nanowire thermocouples and optimization of their fabrication process.},

  Abstract                 = {We study the generation of thermoelectricity by nanoscale thermocouples formed from a single layer of metal with cross-sectional discontinuity. Typically, a thermocouple ({TC}) is formed when a second conductor is inserted between two sections of a first conductor forming two junctions situated at different temperatures. Here, we investigate the behavior of {TCs} formed not of two conductors but rather nanowires of the same metal of two cross-sectional areas. Mono-metallic thermocouples were constructed from a lithographically defined nanowire having one abrupt variation in width along its length, and tested at room temperature; these structures exploit a change in Seebeck coefficient that is present at these size scales. To investigate the thermoelectric properties of such ``shapeengineered'' thermocouples, nanoscale heaters were employed to set the local temperatures. Temperature profiles at the hot and cold junctions of the {TCs} were determined both by simulations and experiments. Results demonstrate that the magnitude of the open-circuit voltage, and hence the relative Seebeck coefficient, is a function of the parameters of the variations in the segment widths. The fabrication complexity of such shape-engineered mono-metallic nanowire {TCs} is greatly reduced compared to that of conventional bi-metallic {TCs}, and could be mass-produced using simpler manufacturing techniques.},

are attractive candidates for various applications including energy

In this paper, we combine our previous work on antenna-coupled

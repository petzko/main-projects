\begin{abstract}
A simple template with few examples is provided for preparing \textit{Optics Express}, \textit{Biomedical Optics Express}, and \textit{Optical Materials Express} manuscripts in \LaTeX. For complete instructions, refer to \texttt{OpEx\_temp.txt}. The Express journal simple and extended templates are also available on \url{http://www.overleaf.com/gallery/tagged/osa}. OSA encourages the use of this free online collaborative tool for writing your OSA article.

\section{Introduction}

Standard \LaTeX{} or AMS\TeX{} environments should be used to place tables, figures, and math. Examples are given below.

\begin{verbatim}
\begin{figure}[htbp]
%\centering\includegraphics[width=7cm]{opexfig1}
\caption{Sample caption (Ref. \cite{Oron03}, Fig. 2).}
\end{figure}

\begin{equation}
H = \frac{1}{2m}(p_x^2 + p_y^2) + \frac{1}{2} M{\Omega}^2
     (x^2 + y^2) + \omega (x p_y - y p_x).
\end{equation}
\end{verbatim}

\section{Conclusion}
After proofreading the manuscript, compress your .TEX manuscript file and all figures (which should be in EPS format, or PDF format if you are using PDF-\LaTeX) in a ZIP, TAR or TAR-GZIP package. Prism, OSA’s article tracking system, will process in \LaTeX mode by default but will use PDF-\LaTeX if PDF figure files are detected. Note: TAR or TAR-GZIP is no longer required. All files must be referenced at the root level (e.g., file \texttt{figure-1.eps}, not \texttt{/myfigs/figure-1.eps}). If there is video or other multimedia, the associated files should be uploaded separately.
